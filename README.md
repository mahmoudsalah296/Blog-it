# Blog-it: A Simple Blogging Website

This repository contains the source code for the backend development of Blog-it, a simple web application for creating and managing blog posts.

## Features:

* Create, edit, and delete blog posts.
* User accounts for secure access and post ownership.
* Categorize posts for better organization.
* Commenting system for user interaction.


## Getting Started

**Prerequisites:**

* Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your system. You can download them from [https://nodejs.org/en](https://nodejs.org/en)

**Installation:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahmoudsalah296/Blog-it.git
cd Blog-it
npm install
```

## Usage

**1. Start the development server:**

```bash
npm start
```
This will typically start the application on port 5000 (http://localhost:5000). You can check the console output for the exact port number.


**2. (Optional) API Testing:**

You can use a tool like Postman to test the application's APIs. The API documentation is still under development, but you can explore the functionalities in two ways:

1. **Send requests directly to the base URL:** `http://localhost:5000/`. Refer to the source code for details on specific API endpoints and their functionalities.
2. **Import the Postman collection for a more comprehensive testing experience:** [Postman API](https://www.postman.com/mennatallahhxx/workspace/blog-it).

**Note:** While API documentation is still under development, you can leverage both methods to explore and test the application's functionalities.


## Technologies Used:
* Node.js: JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development.
* Express.js: Web framework for building web applications and APIs in Node.js.
* JWT (JSON Web Token): A secure way to represent claims (like user information) between different parts of an application.
